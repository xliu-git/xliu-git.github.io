          Xiaohan Liu joined Amazon as a SDE1 in June 2021. From June 2021 to October 2021, She worked on the risk
          protection for
          3P Authorization team in Identity Service. After that, she joined the Meeting Experience team in Enterprise
          Engineering under AWS and worked for hybrid conference management system and meeting schedule panel
          projects.
          <br>
          She graduated from Syracuse University with a M.S. Computer Science degree in May 2021. During that time, she
          worked on some NLP topics related to Covid-19 and 2020 Election.
          She obtained a B.S. Applied Chemistry degree at Tianjin University in July 2019. During her undergraduate, she
          focused on the
          interdisciplinarity of Computer Science and Chemistry&ampBiology. In the summer of 2018, she was elected to be
          a full scholarship
          summer school student in Technion-Israel Institute of Technology for course Introdution to Machine Learning.
          <br>
          <strong> With interests in Software Development/NLP/C++/Full Stack, she's willing to communicate with more
            developers!</strong>
